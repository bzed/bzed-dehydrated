# Base class to setup the letsencrypt certificate handling
# with dehydrated.
#
# @summary Base class to define necessary variables and include setup classes.
#
# @example
#   # should be sufficient in most cases.
#   include dehydrated
#
#   # if you are "upgrading" from bzed-letsencrypt,
#   # you might want to use these options to stay
#   # compatible with the old group/directory:
#   class { 'dehydrated' :
#     group    => 'letsencrypt',
#     base_dir => '/etc/letsencrypt',
#   }
#
# @api public
#
# @param base_dir
#   The base directory where keys/csr/certs are stored.
#   Defaults to:
#   - on $::os['family']=='Debian': /etc/dehydrated
#   - on other Linux/Unix systems: /etc/pki/dehydrated
#   - on windows: C:\LE_certs.
# @param crt_dir
#   The directory where certificates are stored. Defaults to ${base_dir}/certs
# @param csr_dir
#   The directory where CSRs are stored. Defaults to ${base_dir}/csr
# @param key_dir
#   The directory where pricate keys are stored. Defaults to ${base_dir}/private
# @param user
#   Linux: The user who owns the files in /etc/dehydrated.
#   Windows: The user who owns the files in C:\LE_Certs. Needs to be specified!
# @param group
#   Linux: The group which owns the files in /etc/dehydrated.
#     If you have a non-root process which needs to access private keys, add its user to this group.
#   Windows: The group which owns the files in C:\LE_Certs. Needs to be specified!
# @param dehydrated_user
#   User to run the dehydrated script as. Only used on the host that actually requests certificates.
# @param dehydrated_group
#   Group to run the dehydrated script as. Only used on the host that actually requests certificates.
# @param letsencrypt_ca
#   Let’s Encrypt CA to use. Defaults to v2-production. See the letsencrypt_cas parameter for a way
#   to specify your own Let’s Encrypt / ACME compatible CA. This configures the default CA to use, but
#   You can actually define different CAs for each certificate, see the ::dehydrated::certificate
#   define for details.
# @param letsencrypt_cas
#   Hash with the definitions of the official testing and production Let’s Encrypt CAs this
#   puppet module was tested against.
# @param dh_param_size
#   Default size of the DH params we should generate. Defaults to 2048.
# @param challengetype
#   Default challengetype to use. Defaults to 'dns-01'. You can specify a different
#   challengetype for each certificate, see ::dehydrated::certificate.
# @param algorithm
#   Default algorithm / elliptic-curve you want to use. Supported: rsa, secp384r1, prime256v1.
#   Defaults to rsa. You can specify a different algorithm for each certificate,
#   see ::dehydrated::certificate.
# @param dehydrated_base_dir
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host. Path where the dehydrated
#   script and configurations/csrs are being stored. Defaults to '/opt/dehydrated'.
# @param dehydrated_git_dir
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
#   Path where the dehydrated script is being checkout out into using git.
#   Defaults to ${dehydrated_base_dir}/dehydrated.
# @param dehydrated_git_tag
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
#   Version of the dehydrated script we want to use.
#   Change it on your own risk.
# @param dehydrated_git_url
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
#   Git url to clone dehydrated from. If you have an internal mirror/version, you can override
#   the default github url here.
# @param dehydrated_host
#   Default setting for the host you want to request the certificates on.
#   Required on that host, on all others it is used as default for certificates requested
#   via ::dehydrated::certificate. You can specify a different dehydrated_host on each
#   certificate if you want to.
#   If $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host, dehydrated will be installed
#   and the certificate request cronjob will be setup.
# @param dehydrated_requests_dir
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
#   Path where requests that need to be handled are being stored.
# @param dehydrated_hooks_dir
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_requests_config
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_wellknown_dir
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_alpncert_dir
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_host_packages
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_environment
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_domain_validation_hook
#   Only used if $facts['fqdn'] == $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_hook
#   Name of the hook script dehydrated will use to validate the authorization request. The hook script
#   must live in the $dehydrated_hooks_dir on $::dehydrated::dehydrated_host.
# @param dehydrated_contact_email
#   Contact email address for created accounts. We'll create one account for each
#   puppet host.
# @param dehydrated_status_file
#   File the dehydrated job runner will dump its status into. Pretty printed JSON.
# @param dehydrated_monitoring_status_file
#   Status file for monitoring with check_statusfile, see README.md for details.
# @param manage_user
#   Create $dehydrated_user/$dehydrated_group and $user/$group if necessary.
# @param manage_packages
#   Install required packages using ensure_packages?
#   Should be safe to leave enabled in most cases.
# @param pki_packages
#   Required packages to create /etc/pki. Not really used yet.
# @param packages
#   The list of packages we actually need to install to make this module work properly.
#   You are free to modify this list if you need to.
# @param certificates
#   Allows to request certificates instead of using ::dehydrated::certificate.
#   The puppet definition of this rather complex parameter is
#       Array[Variant[Dehydrated::DN, Tuple[Dehydrated::DN, Array[Dehydrated::DN]]]]
#   So basically, you need to specify an Array. Contents are either a
#   - distinguished name
#   - tuple with [distinguished name, array of distinguished names]
#   The first case requests a default certificate. The tuple version will request a
#   SAN certificate.
# @param build_pfx_files
#   Create PKCS12 container with key, certificate and ca certificates.
#   Defaults to true on windows, to false on all other OS.
