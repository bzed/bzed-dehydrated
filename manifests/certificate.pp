# Triggers key and csr generation and requests the certificate
# via the host configured in $dehydrated_host.
# This is the main defined type to use if you want to have a
# certificate. Together with the defaults in the dehydrated
# class you should have everything to make requesting certificates
# possible. Especially the dehydrated::certificate::* types do not
# have a public API and can change without warning. Don't rely on
# them.
# Dehydrated::Certificate[$dn] is also what you want to use to
# subscribe to if you want to restart services after certificates
# have been installed/updated.
#
# @summary Creates key & csr and request the certificate.
#
# @example
#   dehydrated::certificate { 'test.example.com': }
#
# @api public
#
# @param dn
#   The main distinguished name to use for the certificate.
#   Defaults to $name.
#
# @param base_filename
#   The base part of the filename of all related files.
#   For wildcard certificates the * is replaced by _wildcard_.
#   Feel free to use whatever a valid filename is.
# @param subject_alternative_names
#   To request a SAN certificate, pass an array with the
#   alternative names here. The main $dn will be added automatically.
# @param challengetype
#   Default challengetype to use. Defaults to $dehydrated::challengetype,
#   which defaults to 'dns-01'. You can specify a different
#   challengetype for each certificate here.
# @param algorithm
#   Algorithm / elliptic-curve you want to use. Supported: rsa, secp384r1, prime256v1.
#   Defaults to $dehydrated::algorithm, which defaults to 'rsa'.
#   You can specify a different algorithm for each certificate here.
# @param key_size
#   Size of the key if we create a new one.  Only used if algorithm is 'rsa'.
# @param dh_param_size
#   Size of the DH params we should generate. Defaults to $dehydrated::dh_param_size,
#   which defaults to 2048. You can specify a different DH param size for each certificate here.
# @param dehydrated_host
#   $::fqdn of the host which is responsible to request the certificates from
#   the Let's Encrypt CA. Defaults to $dehydrated::dehydrated_host where you can
#   configure your default.
# @param dehydrated_environment
#   Hash with the environment variables to set for the $dehydrated_domain_validation_hook
#   and also for running the hook in dehydrated.
#   Defaults to $dehydrated::dehydrated_environment, empty by default.
# @param dehydrated_hook
#   Name of the hook script you want to use. Can be left on undef if http-01 is being
#   used as challengetype to use the built-in http-01 implementation of dehydrated.
#   Defaults to $dehydrated::dehydrated_hook, which will use "${challengetype}.sh"
#   if the challengetype is not http-01.
# @param letsencrypt_ca
#   Defines the CA you want to use to request certificates. If you want to use a
#   non-supported CA, you need to configure it in $dehydrated::letsencrypt_cas on
#   your $dehydrated_host.
#   Normally, the following CAs are pre-configured:
#   staging, production, v2-staging, v2-production
#   Defaults to $dehydrated::letsencrypt_ca, which points to v2-production.
# @param dehydrated_domain_validation_hook
#   Name of the hook script to run before dehydrated is actually executed.
#   Used to check if a domain is still valid or if you are allowed to modify it.
#   Or whatever else you want to do as preparation.
#   Good thing to use before running into limits by trying to request
#   certificates for domains you don't own.
#   Defaults to $dehydrated::dehydrated_domain_validation_hook where you
#   can configure the default for your setup.
# @param key_password
#   If your key should be protected by a password, specify it here.
# @param preferred_chain
#   Preferred letsencrypt CA chain you want to use
